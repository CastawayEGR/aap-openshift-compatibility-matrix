This repository provides a centralized, community-driven tracker for Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform (AAP) operator and component versions, specifically for deployments on OpenShift. It aims to offer a clear and quick reference for mapping AAP operator releases to their corresponding component versions, such as Controller, EDA, Hub, and more.

## üìã Compatibility Tables

For easy viewing, the raw data has been converted into user-friendly Markdown tables, which are generated from the central CSV file.

* [**Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform 2.4**](./AAP_24.md)
* [**Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform 2.5**](./AAP_25.md)

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

The core of this repository is a simple, automated workflow designed for clarity and easy maintenance.

1.  **Raw Data**: All version information is maintained in respective `AAP_2x.csv` files. These are the single source of truth for the entire repository and the only files that should be edited manually.

2.  **Conversion Script**: A bash script (`csv2md.sh`) reads the `AAP_2x.csv` files. This script can filter rows, remove columns, and format URLs into clickable links.

3.  **Markdown Output**: The script processes the data from each `AAP_2x.csv` file and generates the two Markdown files (`AAP_24.md` and `AAP_25.md`), creating clean, readable tables.

### Automation Example

The Markdown files are automatically generated using the `csv2md.sh` script included in this repository. For example, to regenerate the AAP 2.5 table, the following command is used:

```bash
./scripts/csv2md.sh \
  -t "Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform 2.5 - OpenShift Operator Component versions" \
  ./data/AAP_25.csv > AAP_25.md
```

## ü§ù Contributing

Found a mistake or have an update for a new release? Contributions are highly encouraged!

To contribute, please **submit a pull request with your changes to the `AAP_2x.csv` files only**. Do not edit the Markdown files directly, as they are overwritten by the automation script. Once your pull request is merged, the script will be re-run to update the tables.
